# vs1 P001 CustomEyeAutoBehaviours for Virt a Mate

Custom Eye Auto Behaviors is a replacement for VaM's Auto Behaviors "Auto Blink".

This plugin was created because the blinking is not enough when the eyes of the Anime style character are big.
With vs1 original blink implementation, you can increase the amount of blink morphs applied and select morphs.
Select the button "Set Example Values For Anime Style" to set sample parameter values suitable for Anime style characters.

The following Look has Custom Eye Auto Behaviors set. You can check the settings and behavior. This plugin should work for other anime looks as well.

Notice: If this plugin is enabled, Auto Behaviors "AutoBlink" and "Auto Eyelid Morphs" will be disabled.
